# Prospecting

This is a WIP mod that adds various types of prospecting tools, including sifters, prospecting picks, and gold pans.

It does this in an immersive way. No menus and no chat messages. Depending on what's in the ground beneath your feet, you may find nuggets when prospecting. The types of nuggets you receive can give you an idea of what there might be to mine.

Due to the mod's nature, it's not particularly useful with vanilla ore generation. Because ore is normally distributed, you'll likely just turn up iron nuggets most of the time, occasionally gold nuggets. Therefore, the mod is designed for and intended to be used with mods or mod packs that generate ore in large, spare clusters.
